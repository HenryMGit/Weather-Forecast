# Weather-Forecast

A weather forecast webpage that plays with the DarkSky API and using node to hide API key. It shows the 7-day forecast 
of the weather using icon animation from skycons.js.

## Getting Started

You should have Node js already installed with the express framework. You need to create an account on the DarkSky website to get your own API key. Once you have your API key, you can later use that to replace my dummy API key on the .env-sample file. You can then download all the files and run the website.
